      <h1>Empathy Map and Personas</h1>
      <p>
	The persona should be based on overarching trends you observe amongst all the users you interviewed, not characteristics you observed from a specific individual.
      </p>
      <p>
	Construct 2 personas by creating a four-quadrant empathy map, describing what users think, feel, say, and do for one archetypal character â€‹that will represent part of the spectrum of users you observed. A good persona is one that someone can act out with confidence in different scenarios.

	user A mentioned it's not easy to pour water from the coffee holder to the container on the back, also the noise is kind of loud - if they brew it early in the morning it might wake up roommates. they also mentioned brewing tea is much easier with just boiled water. concerned about the metal mesh not being cleaned regularly, was surprised by the hissing sound after rinsing out the coffee and putting the holder back, unclear when it is done

	is it necessary to have an alarm feature? No cos it will disturb other people, and it is really not necessary, it would be nice to have a timer or something, but it's fine as it is now

	It seems new users tend to notice more details about the coffee maker, like when I asked what is the max volume of the container, the novel user answered it accurately, while the other said they didn't pay attention or "the coffee holder" holds the proper amount of water, there is no need to read - the experienced users did not seem to check the waterline at all.
	one user just put the filter directly on the counter while the other user put it carefully on a paper towel


	persona should have two types, casual user - alternating between tea and coffee, not relying on caffeine, wants better quality and experience, fancy features, innovative experience, clean, tidiness, faster, flavor
	
	experienced user, don't care much about the quality, wants it to do its job - efficiency - don't care for extra features, thinks the simple the better, pay less attention to the interface - it should be just easy to use without much consideration - mention that if the coffee machine is fancy then they have to match with the capsule pods and it's just too much work, it's fine if it needs a bit work since they can do other stuff, faster would be nice but not strictly necessary
