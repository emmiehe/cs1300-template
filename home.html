      <h1>Contextual Inquiry</h1>
      
      <p>
	When observing users, pay careful attention to how they use the interface and make objective observations about their actions. This will be helpful when creating your personas. Look out for any struggles or difficulties that they encounter while using the interface; you’ll write about them later.
      </p>

      <p>
	Write a few sentences or bullets describing the key observations you gained from observing your users. Do not make any assumptions about the users’ behaviors or thought processes. Make sure you note general patterns in their interactions with the interface. How did the users react while using the interface? How does it differ from other users?
      </p>
	<p>
Prepare some questions for users regarding their experiences with the interface. Have questions prepared to get insight about their expectations, experience, motives, and challenges using the interface (steer the user to talk about the interface, not the product. For example, discuss the interactive screen of a self-checkout machine, not the errors it may have while customers pay.)
	</p>

      <p>
	List your questions in a numbered list and summarize the responses of your interviewed users. Be sure to highlight the main points or important patterns. Your summary should be both concise and informative.

      <h1>Empathy Map and Personas</h1>
      <p>
	The persona should be based on overarching trends you observe amongst all the users you interviewed, not characteristics you observed from a specific individual.
      </p>
      <p>
	Construct 2 personas by creating a four-quadrant empathy map, describing what users think, feel, say, and do for one archetypal character ​that will represent part of the spectrum of users you observed. A good persona is one that someone can act out with confidence in different scenarios.

    <div id="storyboard" class="d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center" style="background-color: #BA5624">
      <h1>Storyboard</h1>
      <p>
	Your task is to create a storyboard for one of the personas that you created. See the below figure or  this article for an example of a storyboard, as well as the Understanding lecture. Storyboard your persona’s user journey from start to end. Your storyboards should reflect the goals of your persona and include all necessary steps for using an interface. The entire user journey should be depicted. Under each frame, write a 1 sentence description of what’s happening.
      </p>
      <p>
Your storyboard can either be hand-drawn or created digitally (using a storyboard site below or by taking your own pictures), but it must be well-formatted and legible if hand-drawn.  You should have at least 6 frames. We suggest no more than 12 frames, and there is a strict maximum of 15 frames. State which persona the storyboard is written for.
