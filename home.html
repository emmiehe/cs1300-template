	  <li>User A mentioned several issues while user B and C found them to be trivial:

	      <li>it's not easy to pour water from the coffee holder to the container </li>
	      <li>the noise is somewhat loud </li>

	  <li>None of the users wanted a sound indicator, but user A mentioned that a timer/visual indicator could be good.</li>
	  <li>User A noticed more details about the coffee maker:
	    <ul>
	      <li>when I asked about the max volume of the container, user A answered it accurately</li>
	      <li>the others said they didn't pay attention or "the coffee holder" holds the proper amount of water</li>
